    "extracted_text": "How to handle recharge-limit increase requests? \n\n • We shouldn't be asking for use-case etc, since the customer has traffic on Plivo. At max, we should be asking whether they have a new use-case or an existing. If new, ask for details. • Our recharge limit has been quite relaxed (min $1000), so any customer with no usage shouldn't be asking to increase the limit hence we can deny such requests on support’s end. • For genuine ones, we should do 1 level check ( the last 3 months' spend, spend should be $250 and above from Ryuk  https://ryuk.ovilp.io/payments/bank_transfer_payment_list/ • . And the  MDR/CDR to verify the authenticity of usage.) from support side and then assign to SMS (Aamir or Hamad) or Voice team (Raji) to review the traffic and take a call."
